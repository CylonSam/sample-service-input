# sample-service-input
This is a sample microservice that receives a generic input through HTTP and then publishes it to a RabbitMQ queue.

## Requirements
- Java 21
- Maven 3
- Docker

## How to run
I strongly recommend using intellij (I love it). But if you're hardcore...

```bash
./mvnw package
```
